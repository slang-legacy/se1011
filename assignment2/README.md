##1

```
length = prompt_for_input("Enter length of side of square in meters")
print "The area of the square is #{length**2} square meters."
```

##2

Infinate loop: a loop that will cause a program to never exit normally (though will probably die after a finite number of iterations from exhausting the avaliable memory, or a iteration limit in the langauge). For example, an infinate loop in coffee script could be:

```
loop
    console.log "I'm still going!"
```

Which would print `I'm still going!` until the intrepreter kills it.

##3

`print time` and `set time to time + 1`

#Chapter 3 Exercises

##1

It just prints `I have a dream!`. It also annoys the developer who is reading the code with excessive comments, but for the _user_ it only prints the aforementioned string.

##2

Source = `.java`
Bytecode = `.class`

##3

Comments are put in code because sometimes code needs to be augmented with an explanation to make it easier to read and understand what it does. This is an expecially common problem in verbose, non-functional programming languages like Java, where it is difficult to understand abstract interfaces without reading through everything.

Comments can also be used to generate documentation, and (in some langauges) can even hold in-line test cases.

##5

False - class names are `WrittenLikeThis`. function & variable names start with a lowercase letter `likeThisName`.

##10

Functions, while loops, for loops, and classes are a few of the structures that hold code in braces

##11

```
System.out.println("Here is an example");
```
